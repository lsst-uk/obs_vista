      Set of tasks for complete single frame processing. Analogous to
      SingleFrameDriver.
  step1:

      - characterizeImage
      - calibrate
      - writeSourceTable
      - transformSourceTable

      Per-detector tasks that can be run together to start the DRP pipeline.
      These may or may not be run with 'tract' or 'patch' as part of the data
      ID expression. This specific pipeline contains no tasks that require full
      visits. Running with 'tract' (and 'patch') constraints will select
      partial visits that overlap that region.
      In data release processing, operators should stop to address unexpected
      failures before continuing on to step2.
  step2:
    subset:
      - consolidateSourceTable
      - consolidateVisitSummary
      - isolatedStarAssociation
      - finalizeCharacterization
      - makeCcdVisitTable
      - makeVisitTable
      - updateVisitSummary
    description: |
      Tasks that can be run together, but only after the 'step1'.
      This is a mix of visit-level, tract-level, and collection-level tasks
      that must be run with a skymap data query constraint only (an instrument
      constraint is fine, but generally unneccessary).  For example, running
      with 'tract' (and 'patch') constraints will select partial visits that
      overlap that region.  A skymap constraint is necessary to prevent
      isolatedStarAssociation from producing results for all skymaps in the
      data repository.
      Visit-level tasks include consolidateSourceTable, consolidateVisitSummary,
      finalizeCharacterization, updateVisitSummary.
      Tract-level tasks include: isolatedStarAssociation
      Full collection-level tasks include: makeCcdVisitTable, makeVisitTable

      Tasks that can be run together, but only after the 'step1' and 'step2'
      subsets.
      These should be run with explicit 'tract' constraints essentially all the
      time, because otherwise quanta will be created for jobs with only partial
      visit coverage.
      It is expected that many forcedPhotCcd quanta will "normally" fail when
      running this subset, but this isn't a problem right now because there are
      no tasks downstream of it.  If other tasks regularly fail or we add tasks
      downstream of forcedPhotCcd, these subsets or the tasks will need
      additional changes.
      This subset is considered a workaround for missing middleware and task
      functionality.  It may be removed in the future.
