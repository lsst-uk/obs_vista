      Per-detector tasks that can be run together to start the DRP pipeline.
      These may or may not be run with 'tract' or 'patch' as part of the data
      ID expression. This specific pipeline contains no tasks that require full
      visits. Running with 'tract' (and 'patch') constraints will select
      partial visits that overlap that region.
      In data release processing, operators should stop to address unexpected
      failures before continuing on to step2.
  step2:
    subset:
      - consolidateSourceTable
      - consolidateVisitSummary
      - isolatedStarAssociation
      - finalizeCharacterization
      - makeCcdVisitTable
      - makeVisitTable
      - updateVisitSummary
    description: |
      Tasks that can be run together, but only after the 'step1'.
      This is a mix of visit-level, tract-level, and collection-level tasks
      that must be run with a skymap data query constraint only (an instrument
      constraint is fine, but generally unneccessary).  For example, running
      with 'tract' (and 'patch') constraints will select partial visits that
      overlap that region.  A skymap constraint is necessary to prevent
      isolatedStarAssociation from producing results for all skymaps in the
      data repository.
      Visit-level tasks include consolidateSourceTable, consolidateVisitSummary,
      finalizeCharacterization, updateVisitSummary.
      Tract-level tasks include: isolatedStarAssociation
      Full collection-level tasks include: makeCcdVisitTable, makeVisitTable

      Tasks that can be run together, but only after the 'step1' and 'step2'
      subsets.
      These should be run with explicit 'tract' constraints essentially all the
      time, because otherwise quanta will be created for jobs with only partial
      visit coverage.
      It is expected that many forcedPhotCcd quanta will "normally" fail when
      running this subset, but this isn't a problem right now because there are
      no tasks downstream of it.  If other tasks regularly fail or we add tasks
      downstream of forcedPhotCcd, these subsets or the tasks will need
      additional changes.
      This subset is considered a workaround for missing middleware and task
      functionality.  It may be removed in the future.

    description: |
      Tasks that can be run together, but only after the 'step1', 'step2' and
      'step3' subsets
      These detector-level tasks should not be run with 'tract' or 'patch' as
      part of the data ID expression if all reference catalogs or diffIm
      templates that cover these detector-level quanta are desired.
  step5:
    subset:
      - drpAssociation
      - drpDiaCalculation
      - forcedPhotCcdOnDiaObjects
      - forcedPhotDiffOnDiaObjects

      - consolidateAssocDiaSourceTable
      - consolidateFullDiaObjectTable
      - writeForcedSourceOnDiaObjectTable

      - consolidateForcedSourceOnDiaObjectTable
    description: |
      Tasks that can be run together, but only after the 'step1', 'step2',
      'step3', and 'step4' subsets
      This step includes patch-level aggregation Tasks. These should be run
      with explicit 'tract' constraints in the data query, otherwise quanta
      will be created for jobs with only partial visit coverage.
      'consolidateForcedSourceTable' is a tract-level task that aggregates
      patches and should be rerun if any of the patches fail.
  step6:
    subset:
      - consolidateDiaSourceTable
    description: |
      Tasks that can be run together, but only after the 'step1', 'step2',
      'step3', and 'step4' subsets
      This step includes visit-level aggregation tasks. Running without tract
      or patch in the data query is recommended, otherwise the outputs of
      consolidateDiaSourceTable will not contain complete visits.
      This subset is separate from step4 to signal to operators to pause to
      assess unexpected image differencing failures before these aggregation
      steps. Otherwise, if run in the same quantum graph, aggregated data
      products (e.g. diaObjects) would not be created if one or more of the
      expected inputs is missing.
  step7:
    subset:
      - consolidateHealSparsePropertyMaps
    description: |
      Tasks that should be run as the final step that require global inputs,
      and can be run after the 'step3' subset.
      This step has global aggregation tasks to run over all visits, detectors,
      tracts, etc.  This step should be run only with the instrument constraint
      in the data query.
  step8:
    subset:
      - analyzeObjectTableCore
      - analyzeObjectTableSurveyCore
      - catalogMatchTract
      - refCatObjectTract
      - diff_matched_analysis
    description: |
      Core (most important), coadd-level plots/metrics from analysis_tools.
      Must be run after 'step3' (writeObjectTable). Cannot be run with any
      dataquery constraints if analyzeObjectTableSurveyCore is included.
      Can be run together with analysis_drp subsets, e.g. pipeline.yaml
      (hash/pound sign)step8,analysis_coadd_plots,imsim_analysis_coadd_plots
      Includes extended-level diff_matched_analysis metrics, which are
      considered core for DC2 as they can't be run on other datasets yet.

      Set of tasks for calculation of metrics via faro.
      These tasks are a mix of visit- and tract-level.
      Tasks that require single-frame products use Calibrated Source Tables,
      which are available after consolidateSourceTable (step2).
      Tasks that require coadd products use Object Tables which are available
      after consolidateObjectTable (step3).
