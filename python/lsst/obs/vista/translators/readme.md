# astro_metadata_translator plugins for obs_vista

As we develop the gen 3 version of obs_vista we develop local metadata translators which could hopefully be transferred to the official package when they become stable. This is done as an attempt to follow the practice in the [obs_lsst](https://github.com/lsst/obs_lsst/tree/master/python/lsst/obs/lsst/translators) package.
